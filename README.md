## Blackjack

### Description
This is a program which lets the user play a simple game of Blackjack, a very common game customarily played in casinos. The program prompts the user if they wish to play - if so, the "dealer" will deal out cards according to the rules of Blackjack. The user can either hit or stay after the initial dealing, in the case that they do not have blackjack from the start.

This is a program which primarily utilizes OO-programming, representing many of the objects required in Blackjack in their separate classes. For example, the dealer has a deck, which has cards, which has suit and rank, and each of these things has their own class, and so on and so forth.

### Skill Distillery Week 3 Homework
This project was assigned after Week 3 of Skill Distillery's Java Coding
School.

#### Technologies Used

* Java
* Interfaces, OO, Polymorphism
* UML Diagrams
* Enumeration classes

#### Lessons Learned

* How to have objects interact with other objects.
* Using enumerated fields for values which will always be constant.
* Polymorphism which allows flexibility for methods to call subclasses.
* Field visibility, encapsulation, and proper getter/setter methods.
* Abstract classes and methods.
